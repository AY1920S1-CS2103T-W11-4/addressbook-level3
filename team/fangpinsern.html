<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My team was tasked with improving the basic Address Book 3 (AB3) application
for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph the existing AB3
application to a calorie recording system called CaloFit which also stores a native
food database with accurate calorie information.
This enhanced application enables individuals to track their calorie intake
everyday, manage their diet and get monthly reports on their calorie consumption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CaloFit is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application that assist users
in keeping track of their calories. It was designed with the user experience in
mind as we set to keep the number of commands to a minimum. The Graphic User Interface (GUI)
created using JavaFX displays useful information clearly to the user. To interact
with CaloFit, the user just enters a command at the top in the command box and
press the <code>Enter</code> key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shown below in Figure 1 is how the project looks like:</p>

<p>My role was to design and write the codes for the meal tracking which are the add, edit
and delete commands. The following sections illustrate my contributions to the
project as well as relevant documentations I have added to the user and developer guide

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation,
and other helpful contributions to the team project</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to generate a Report</strong>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: creates a Report that displays the statistics calculated from the user&#8217;s meal history for that particualar month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature gives purpose to the application as the user should be someone who wants to keep track of their calorie intake. By implementing this feature, the user is able to know their calorie intake for the month, as well as other statistics generated from it, whenever they want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: As virtually any form of statistical data can be generated from a user&#8217;s meal history, the scope of the data calculated and shown to the user is not exhaustive. The statistics chosen to be calculated are decided based on the user stories and use cases that our team has considered and is linked here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits: {Calculation of statistics}</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added <strong>automatic saving of the meal history of the user as a JavaScript Objection Notation(JSON) file</strong>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The user&#8217;s meal entries into CaloFit will be saved into a JSON file, allowing the user&#8217;s meal history to be loaded upon starting up CaloFit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This small feature is crucial as we need to ensure that the user&#8217;s meal log is saved in order to track his or her progress since he or she started using CaloFit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits: The methods and structure of converting a Class into a JSON file was taken from the original AddressBook-Level 3 and refactored for the purpose mentioned above.</p>

<p>The <code>add</code> feature is implemented through the <code>AddCommand</code> class that extends the abstract <code>Command</code> class.
It interacts with other objects through the <code>Model</code> interface to manipulate the meal log and dish database to add meals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The addition of meals is done through <code>Model#addMeal()</code> which would add the meal from the meal log list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>add</code> feature uses the Model to check if the dish is already in the database.
If the dish is already in the database, the meal will be added to the meal log only through the <code>Model#addMeal()</code> method.
If the dish the user wants to add is not in the database,
then the dish will be added to both the meal log and the dish database through the <code>Model#addMeal()</code> and
<code>Model#addDish()</code> methods respectively.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To detect whether the calorie tag is used in the user input, we use an UNKNOWN_CALORIE in the Calorie class.
This will trigger either search for the dish in the dish database or create a new dish and input it into the dish database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The input by the user and the dish in the dish database is considered equal only if both the name and the calorie information are the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Addition of tags are supported. However, they are not crucial to the implementation of the add
function as tags are not considered when deciding equality of dishes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="addition-though-indexes-in-suggested-find-meal-list-e-g-add-1-2-3"><a class="link" href="#addition-though-indexes-in-suggested-find-meal-list-e-g-add-1-2-3">Addition though indexes in suggested/find meal list (e.g add 1 2 3)</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>add</code> feature also supports the addition of meals through indexes in the suggested meal list.
This is done to improve the user experience as they do not have to always enter the long commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature is also implemented through the <code>AddCommand</code> class that extends the abstract <code>Command</code> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>add</code> command in this case takes in a list of numbers pass to it through the <code>AddCommandParser</code>. The checking of valid
indexes is done by the <code>AddCommandParser</code>. Once the list is passed to the <code>AddCommand</code>, it calls <code>Model#getFilteredDishlist()</code>
which returns the filtered dish list. The add command will then loop through
the list of indexes and get the respective dishes from the filtered dish list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We cannot add the meal immediately to the meal log as the filtered dish list would change when the calorie count changes. Hence the
meals are first added to separate a <code>toBeAddedMealList</code> and once all the indexes are added to that list,
<code>MealLog#addListOfMeals(toBeAddedMealList)</code> is called to add all the meals in to the meal log at once.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Complications when adding meals.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Compare name only</p>

<li>
<p>Cons: May cause the dish database to get very large just because the tag is different</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explanation of choice:</strong> As a calorie counter, the calories is an important
part of the meal. Hence we need to consider it when comparing meals. Certain meals
with the same name may not have the same amount of calories. Hence we decided to go
with alternative 1.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explanation of choice:</strong> The user may consume the same meal within the day. If we use a hash
map, we will not be able to store the duplicate meals easily. Hash map does not preserve order.
Hence, showing on the meal list section would be difficult as well. A user may not have a large
amount of meals daily. Hence the array list would not be that large. Therefore, despite its limitation,
an array list is still used.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>delete</code> feature is implemented through the <code>DeleteCommand</code> class that extends the abstract <code>Command</code> class.
It interacts with other objects through the <code>Model</code> interface to manipulate the meal log and remove meals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>delete</code> command allows for removal of multiple dishes with a single command.
The <code>delete</code> command takes in a <code>listOfIndex</code> passed to it by the <code>DeleteCommandParser</code>. The checking of valid integers
is done by the <code>DeleteCommandParser</code>. Once the listOfIndex is passed to the <code>DeleteCommand</code>, it sorts the list from largest index
to smallest index using the <code>Collections.sort(listOfIndex, Comparator.reverseOrder())</code>. The <code>DeleteCommand</code> then loops through
the sorted list and checks if the index is within the size of the meal log. If the index is valid, <code>DeleteCommand</code> will
remove the respective meal from the meal log.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The removal of meals is done through the <code>Model#removeMeal(meal)</code> which would remove the meal from the meal log list.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (Current Choice):</strong> Removed after the listOfIndex is sorted.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Prevent the reordering of the meal log causing the larger indexes to correspond to a different meal or
out of bounds. (e.g delete 1 2 for a meal log with 2 meals. If we delete 1 first, the meal log will change to having 1 meal.
The meal previously at index 2 is now at index 1. When doing delete 2, the meal at index 2 is now out of bounds as the meal log
only has 1 meal.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: The command may take some time when handling large amounts of input. This is due to the sorting required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Loop through the indexes in the <code>DeleteCommandParser</code> and create a new <code>DeleteCommand</code> for every index.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Simple morphing of previous delete method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Have to change other parts of the model breaking abstraction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Explanation of Choice:</strong> The command is for the deletion of meals for that day. A person on average consumes 3 - 4 meals a day.
Hence on average, the most meals to be deleted is 4. Thus the sorting time would not be too significant.</p>
